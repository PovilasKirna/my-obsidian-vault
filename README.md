Because of course you can use community plugins

# AND THE BEST PART - IT'S FREE!


# We can add tags
#hello-world #readme #md #intro #learning #fun

We can even 
> Quote
> As much as we want

Or link something with just a few [button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button) presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>

Due to a convenient community plugin ðŸ˜±
